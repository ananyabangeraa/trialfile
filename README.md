# trialfile - A repository of various experiments done with Python!
This is officially my first repository on GitHub, so yay to that! It's called the trialfile becuase it's my first attempt at applying Python to make some interesting stuff. 
I will progress from beginner to intermediate and cover everything that I'm curious about. 
This repository will use all of the concepts that I learn throughout the course of 2022. I want to be able to merge all of these snippets and end up with an interesting project that utlises all of the concepts in Python for everybody as well as Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.
